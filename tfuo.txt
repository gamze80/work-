The nice thing about conditional jumps is that you arenâ€™t limited to just terminating loops; you can also use them to make decisions. For example, you should now be able to write a Hmmm program that prints the absolute value of a number. The other conditional jump statements in Hmmm are included in the listing of all Hmmm instructions at the end of this chapter.
